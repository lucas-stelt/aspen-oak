# AspenOak Bakery — Website Project

## Project Overview
Freelance website for AspenOak, a scratch-made bakery, coffee shop, and curated pantry located at 633 N 8th Street, Downtown Sheboygan, WI. Built by Lucas Steltenpohl.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks, no build tools)
- **Hosting:** Netlify (free tier) — auto-deploys from GitHub `main` branch
- **Publish directory:** `site/` (configured in `netlify.toml`)
- **Functions directory:** `netlify/functions/` — serverless functions (esbuild bundler)
- **Domain:** aspenoakhome.com — live, registered on Netlify in Lucas's name
- **Online Ordering:** Square Payment Links API via Netlify Function (Phase 2 — in progress, deployed but not fully tested)

## Key Client Info
- **Business:** AspenOak
- **Location:** 633 N 8th Street, Sheboygan, WI
- **Hours:** Mon–Fri 8–5, Sat 8–3, Sun 8–12
- **Social:** @AspenOakHome on Instagram and Facebook
- **Square POS:** Active in-store, Square account exists
- **Content updates:** Owner will share new photos/menu items via iCloud shared drive (frequency: daily to weekly)

## Development Workflow
1. Edit files in `site/`
2. `git add` + `git commit` + `git push origin main`
3. Netlify auto-deploys within ~30 seconds

## Custom Slash Commands
- `/update-menu` — step-by-step guide for adding/editing menu items
- `/add-photo` — guide for adding new photos to the site
- `/deploy-check` — pre-deploy verification checklist

## Square Integration
- **Approach:** Custom cart UI on `order.html` → Netlify Function → Square Payment Links API → redirect to Square hosted checkout
- **Function:** `netlify/functions/create-checkout.mjs` — Netlify V2 format, validates items server-side, hardcoded prices, calls `POST /v2/online-checkout/payment-links`, serves at `/api/create-checkout` via `export const config`
- **Netlify env vars required:** `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID`, `SQUARE_ENV` (`sandbox` or `production`)
- **Local env vars:** same keys in `.env` file (gitignored)
- **Status:** ✅ Sandbox end-to-end test PASSED — cart → checkout → Square payment page flow is working
- **Sandbox location ID:** `LDCGF33Z8G3QZ` (already set in Netlify env vars)
- **Test card (sandbox):** `4111 1111 1111 1111`, any future expiry, any CVV
- **Go-live checklist:** Swap `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID` in Netlify env vars to production values, set `SQUARE_ENV=production`, trigger redeploy
- **Local dev note:** `netlify dev` crashes on this machine due to Deno EBUSY (corporate AV blocks exe). Use `netlify functions:serve` for local function testing instead.

## Development Workflow
1. Edit files in `site/` or `netlify/functions/`
2. Test locally with `netlify dev` (serves on `http://localhost:8888`)
3. `git add` + `git commit` + `git push origin main`
4. Netlify auto-deploys within ~30 seconds

## Planned Work
- [x] Connect GitHub repo to Netlify (auto-deploy active)
- [x] Purchase and configure custom domain (aspenoakhome.com — live)
- [x] Square ordering UI built and deployed (`order.html` + Netlify function)
- [x] Debug and complete Square sandbox end-to-end test
- [ ] Swap to Square production credentials and go live
- [ ] Automated content pipeline (iCloud shared drive → GitHub → Netlify)

## Notes
- All image files must be added to `site/assets/` — never use absolute paths
- Menu items and prices change frequently — always verify with client before updating
- Remove/refresh any seasonal sections in `menu.html` after the holiday passes (e.g. the old Easter section, removed 2026-06-15)
- Item prices in `create-checkout.mjs` `ITEMS` map must stay in sync with `order.html` display prices AND `menu.html`. Current sandwich prices: Plain Jane $8.50, The Dilly $9.50
- `order.html` product cards drive the modal: `data-options` (pipe-separated) + `data-option-label` add a flavor/soda selector; `data-bagel="true"` adds the bagel selector + drink upsell and marks the item weekend-only. New orderable items must also be added to the `ITEMS` map (with a `variants` allow-list) in `create-checkout.mjs`
- Bagel sandwiches are weekend-pickup-only, enforced both in `order.html` (day dropdown) and server-side in `create-checkout.mjs`
- iPhone `.HEIC` photos: drop into `site/assets/`, add a name mapping in `automation/convert_heic.py`, run it to produce web `.jpg`. HEIC originals are gitignored (don't commit/deploy them)
- taste-skill is installed (8 skills via `npx skills add`) — restart Claude Code to use them
- Never commit `.env` — credentials go in Netlify environment variables for production
